#+Title: noxml-fold-mode

This is a minor mode that tries to enable useful folding for XML
files, copying a lot from AUCTeX's tex-fold.el. It builds on
nxml-mode, and will probably break horribly if it is not the
major-mode.

** Installation

*** Melpa

If you're using MELPA, ~M-x list-packages RET C-s noxml-fold i x~
should work.


*** From Github

1) Get the repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   git clone https://github.com/paddymcall/noxml-fold.git ./some_dir
   #+END_SRC
2) Edit your ~/.emacs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   (add-to-list 'load-path "<<./path/to/some_dir>>")
   (add-hook 'nxml-mode-hook (lambda () (require 'noxml-fold)))
   #+END_SRC


** Usage

With an open xml file, make sure you're in nxml-mode, and load
noxml-fold with ~M-x noxml-fold-mode~.

The most useful entry points are ~noxml-fold-dwim~, and
~noxml-fold-region~. For smaller files, you can also try
~noxml-fold-buffer~.

** Limitations

Since this mode uses overlays, it does *not* scale: for very long or
deeply nested XML structures, you should only fold what's within view
(`noxml-fold-visible'), or make use of `narrow-to-region'.
